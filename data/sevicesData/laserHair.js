        'Laser hair removal is a cosmetic procedure that uses concentrated light to remove unwanted hair. The laser emits a beam of light that is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicles, preventing future hair growth. This non-invasive treatment is effective for various areas, providing long-term hair reduction with minimal discomfort. Popular areas for laser hair removal include the face, underarms, legs, and bikini line. Multiple sessions are usually required for optimal results, as hair follicles are in different growth phases.
